# Hybrid Music-Recommendation-System
Recommendation System Project

In this project, we have designed, implemented and analyzed a song
recommendation system. We used Million Song Dataset provided by Kaggle to find
correlations between users and songs and to learn from the previous listening
history of users to provide recommendations for songs which users would prefer to
listen most. 

We have discussed the problems we faced, methods we have
implemented, results and their analysis. We have got best results for item similarity
based collaborative filtering algorithm. We believe that content-based model would
have worked better if we would have enough memory and computational power to
use the whole available metadata and training dataset.
